He settled a lawsuit with his former management company, Horizon Sports Management, for a rumored $20 million in 2015, after initially suing them over what he called an \"unconscionable\" contract. Horizon Sports Management also counter-sued McIlroy for unpaid fees. This legal battle was described as a \"nasty\" rift and led to McIlroy not playing golf again until late February 2015.\n\nMore recently, McIlroy, along with Tiger Woods and the PGA Tour, was sued by Larry Klayman in November 2024 over the LIV Golf dispute. Klayman also filed a similar lawsuit in 2022 and alleges that McIlroy and others acted maliciously against LIV Golf. McIlroy and Woods were given deadlines to sit for depositions as part of this antitrust case in January 2024. This legal tension also spilled over into a public incident with Patrick Reed in January 2023, where McIlroy did not reciprocate Reed's greeting, and Reed then threw a golf tee in McIlroy's direction. McIlroy stated that he had been subpoenaed by Reed's lawyer on Christmas Eve, which contributed to his reaction.\n\nMcIlroy also faced controversy during the 2025 PGA Championship when his driver was deemed non-conforming by USGA testing.

This culminated in his being removed from the team during a season where he was expected to play his final year in the NBA. There were also instances where Paul was perceived as being \"too vocal\" and \"too critical,\" to the point where his presence was considered detrimental to the locker room atmosphere. Additionally, in 2011, a trade that would have sent Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers was controversially voided by the NBA, though he was subsequently traded to the Clippers. There have also been discussions among fans about his on-court behavior, with some perceiving him as playing an \"annoying\" style that involves drawing fouls."}, {"year": "2015", "name": "Buster Posey", "age": "27", "title": "", "company": "", "category": "", "description": "Catcher for SF Giants, World Series champion", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2015", "name": "Arian Radmand", "age": "29", "title": "", "company": "", "category": "", "description": "Cofounder of CoachUp private coaching marketplace", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2015", "name": "Uzma Rawn", "age": "29", "title": "", "company": "", "category": "", "description": "VP of Corporate Partnerships at Premier Partnerships", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2015", "name": "Cristiano Ronaldo", "age": "29", "title": "", "company": "", "category": "", "description": "Forward for Real Madrid, Ballon d'Or winner", "fraud": "Lawsuit: Sued for rape by Kathryn Mayorga alleging assault in Las Vegas (2009).

He has also defended the site against accusations of antisemitism, pointing out that many of its staff members are Jewish and that it is pro-Israel.\n\nIn 2017, Marlow made controversial statements regarding the definition of rape, suggesting that women had exploited the term in the wake of the #MeToo movement. He also claimed that the widespread accusations made it difficult to distinguish between genuine assaults and regretful encounters. These remarks drew criticism, with some labeling Breitbart as misogynistic.\n\nFurther controversy arose in late 2017 when Marlow admitted that Breitbart's strong support for Roy Moore, an Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct, was partly motivated by a desire to protect Donald Trump. Marlow conceded that Leigh Corfman's accusations against Moore \"had a lot of credibility,\" but Breitbart continued its defense of Moore, which Marlow attributed to a strategy to preemptively set a standard for sexual misconduct allegations that Trump himself might not be able to meet. This led to accusations that Breitbart subordinated factual reporting to its political agenda.\n\nIn 2025, a lawsuit was filed by Fox News host Gregg Jarrett, accusing Simon & Schuster of stealing a book idea and giving it to Marlow instead.

He was charged by the SEC in 2015 for illegally selling penny stock shares, which he had secretly obtained through offshore front companies. The SEC's complaint alleged that Mulholland accumulated a majority of shares in Vision Plasma Systems Inc. and then liquidated them for at least $21 million. In a parallel criminal case, Mulholland pleaded guilty to money-laundering conspiracy charges in May 2016 and was awaiting sentencing. He was arrested in June 2015 on charges of securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy for allegedly manipulating stocks of U.S. publicly-traded companies and laundering approximately $300 million in profits.\n\nThis was not Mulholland's first encounter with the SEC; he was previously charged in 2011 for a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme involving a company founded by Daniel Ruettiger, the inspiration for the movie \"Rudy.\" In 2013, the SEC obtained a monetary judgment against him for over $5.3 million, which remained unpaid. In December 2016, Mulholland settled civil charges with the SEC, accepting a ban from participating in U.S. public markets. He went to jail in February 2017. More recently, in December 2022, the B.C. Securities Commission banned him from its capital markets.

She has also been accused of using her identity to shield herself from backlash.\n\nWhile some of these criticisms have been framed as constructive feedback, others have been more severe, with some labeling her actions and persona as problematic or cringe-worthy."}, {"year": "2016", "name": "Alicia Vikander", "age": "27", "title": "", "company": "", "category": "", "description": "Actor", "fraud": "Alicia Vikander has been associated with a controversy surrounding the film \"The Danish Girl,\" where she starred alongside Eddie Redmayne.

Some in the community also criticized him for having \"pronouns in bio checks out\" in response to criticism, which was seen as invalidating.

This led to a bathroom controversy at the U.S. Capitol, where McBride was reportedly barred from using women's bathrooms.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has made baseless accusations, calling McBride a \"groomer\" and \"child predator\" in response to a video of McBride reading to children as part of a Human Rights Campaign Foundation initiative.\n\nThere have also been instances of McBride being misgendered by Republican colleagues during House hearings. In one such incident, Republican Rep. Keith Self introduced McBride as \"Mr. McBride,\" which led to the adjournment of the hearing. McBride has stated that she is \"mystified\" that Republicans are making trans people a \"priority\" through proposed federal anti-trans legislation, viewing it as a \"politics of misdirection and distraction\".

Reports allege that this deal was a way to circumvent NBA salary cap rules and pay Leonard more than allowed, functioning as a \"no-show\" job where he allegedly performed little to no promotional obligations. This led to Aspiration investors suing Steve Ballmer for fraud, claiming they were misled about the company's activities and that Ballmer used Aspiration to secretly funnel money to Leonard. The NBA has launched an investigation into these allegations. Leonard's representatives have not commented on these claims, while the Clippers and Ballmer have denied any wrongdoing, stating that they did not circumvent the salary cap. Aspiration has since filed for bankruptcy, and Leonard is listed as a creditor, with the company allegedly owing him $7 million.\n\nFurthermore, Leonard's exit from the San Antonio Spurs in 2018 was a major point of controversy. Reports suggest that his uncle, Dennis Robertson, played a significant role in the dispute, allegedly interfering with the team's medical process and seeking outside opinions. This led to a breakdown in trust between Leonard and the Spurs organization. Some fans and media members felt that Leonard \"quit on the team\" or faked his injury, claims that Leonard admitted hurt him. This controversial departure has continued to be a topic of discussion among former Spurs players and fans.\n\nAdditionally, a lawsuit was filed by Randy Shelton, a performance coach who previously worked with Leonard and the Clippers. Shelton is suing the Clippers organization and team president Lawrence Frank for wrongful termination, alleging that the organization used him to tamper with Leonard's free agency and subjected Leonard to \"unsafe and illegal treatment\" regarding his health and safety.

Some fans expressed dissatisfaction with her evolving musical direction and personal style, leading to negative comments. Additionally, her role in the 2024 film \"Megalopolis\" involved playing a character caught in a \"deep-fake sex scandal,\" which was part of her acting career's exploration of more mature themes.

This led to widespread commentary, with news outlets describing it as a \"nightmare\" and a \"dream can be over within seconds\".\n\nAnother controversy arose in Semmering, Austria, in late 2025, where Shiffrin's request for a course change before the second run of a slalom race led to discussions about preferential treatment.

This penalty stemmed from a television viewer who emailed the LPGA to report a rule violation Thompson committed the previous day. The viewer claimed Thompson did not properly replace her ball before putting on the 17th hole during the third round. LPGA officials investigated the claim and determined that Thompson had breached Rule 20-7c (Playing From Wrong Place), resulting in a two-stroke penalty. She also received an additional two-stroke penalty for returning an incorrect scorecard, as she was unaware of the breach when she signed it. Thompson ultimately lost the major in a playoff to So Yeon Ryu. This incident generated significant controversy and criticism from fellow golfers and the public, with many questioning the fairness of penalties issued after the fact based on viewer input.\n\nIn another incident in 2020 at the Women's British Open, Thompson was involved in a situation where she moved grass away from her ball with her club head before a shot. While some fans and observers viewed this as a potential rule violation that could improve her lie, it was ultimately determined by officials that the grass had returned to its original position, and therefore, no breach of Rule 8.1 occurred. Although she did not make the cut in that tournament, she avoided a penalty.\n\nMore recently, in 2023, Thompson faced scrutiny after a Solheim Cup match where she shanked a crucial shot on the 18th hole. In the post-round press conference, she initially refused to comment on the shot, a response that was labeled a \"terrible question\" by U.S. captain Stacy Lewis. Thompson's reaction drew criticism on social media, but she was defended by her teammate Korda, who highlighted the pressure of the game and suggested the media was being overly critical."}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Adam White", "age": "24", "title": "Founder", "company": "Front Office Sports", "category": "Sports", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "David Wise", "age": "28", "title": "Freestyle Skier", "company": "Team USA", "category": "Sports", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Jason Black", "age": "28", "title": "Principal", "company": "RRE Ventures", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Hootan Rashidifard", "age": "29", "title": "Co-Heads", "company": "Canaan Beta", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Adina Tecklu", "age": "27", "title": "Co-Heads", "company": "Canaan Beta", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Laura Chau", "age": "29", "title": "Principal", "company": "Canaan Partners", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Vik Chawla", "age": "29", "title": "Principal", "company": "Fifth Wall Ventures Management, LLC", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "David Cheng", "age": "27", "title": "Vice President", "company": "DCM", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Teddy Citrin", "age": "28", "title": "Investor", "company": "Greycroft", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Michael Dempsey", "age": "28", "title": "Partner", "company": "Compound", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Peter Doyle", "age": "25", "title": "Investor", "company": "Accel", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2019", "name": "Masha Drokova", "age": "29", "title": "General Partner", "company": "Day One Ventures", "category": "Venture Capital", "description": "", "fraud": "Masha Drokova (also known as Masha Bucher) has been associated with controversies and scandals due to her past connections and business dealings.

Upstart Holdings, Inc. et al.*** (Case No. 2:22-cv-02935) and ***Chung v. Upstart Holdings, Inc. et al.*** (Case No. 2:22-cv-03620), filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.\n*   **Allegations:** The lawsuits allege that Gu and other Upstart executives violated the **Securities Exchange Act of 1934** by making false or misleading statements regarding the efficacy of Upstart's AI-driven underwriting model. Plaintiffs argue the company misrepresented the model's ability to \"quickly adjust\" to changing macroeconomic conditions and interest rate hikes, leading to significant investor losses when the stock price plummeted from a peak of over $400 to below $20.\n*   **Legal Status:** In 2023 and 2024, the court denied motions to dismiss many of these claims. Notably, the court allowed claims of **securities fraud** and **insider trading** against Gu and other top executives to proceed, finding a \"strong inference of scienter\" (intent or knowledge of wrongdoing) regarding their public statements.\n\n### **Insider Trading Allegations**\nAs part of the aforementioned securities litigation, the court sustained claims specifically targeting Paul Gu for **insider trading**. \n*   **The Controversy:** Plaintiffs allege that Gu and other insiders sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Upstart stock while in possession of non-public information about the deteriorating performance of the company's loan portfolio. \n*   **Defense:** In regulatory filings and public statements, these transactions have been described as being conducted under **Rule 10b5-1 trading plans**, which are intended to provide a legal defense against insider trading by pre-scheduling sales. However, the timing and volume of these sales remain a central point of the ongoing litigation.\n\n### **Model Performance Controversy**\nGu, as the architect of Upstart\u2019s AI models, has been the primary figure associated with the controversy over the company's \"Macro Index\" and the subsequent rise in delinquency rates.

She argued that it was a sign of love and appreciation, but this was met with criticism, with some calling her comments \"ignorant\" and \"offensive\". In 2018, she faced backlash for a past comment she made about fellow model Duckie Thot's natural hair, which some interpreted as an insult.\n*   **Perceived arrogance and attitude:** During her time on \"America's Next Top Model\" (ANTM) and in subsequent appearances, some viewers and individuals have perceived Harlow as arrogant, having a \"stank face and bad attitude,\" and not contributing much as a guest judge on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\". There were also claims that she spread rumors about a fellow contestant and a host on ANTM.\n*   **Criticism about her success:** Some have questioned whether her success is due to her modeling ability or her vitiligo, with one Reddit user stating, \"She is a very average model and if she didn't have the Vitiligo wouldn't be as successful as she is now\".\n*   **Halloween costume controversy:** In 2025, she apologized for a Halloween costume of Whitney Houston at the 2001 BET Awards, which some found to be insensitive and mocking of Houston's struggles.\n\nDespite these controversies, Harlow has also been praised for her advocacy for diversity in the fashion industry and for raising awareness about vitiligo.

While the founders stated they were transparent with beta customers about having a \"human in the loop\", some users criticized this approach as misrepresentation and potential fraud.\n\nMore significantly, Fireflies.ai is facing a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court, *Cruz v. Fireflies.AI Corp.*. The lawsuit alleges that the company illegally collects and stores biometric voice data of meeting participants without their knowledge or consent, violating Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The complaint asserts that Fireflies.ai's tool records, analyzes, transcribes, and stores unique vocal characteristics (\"voiceprints\") of all participants, including those who are not users of the service.

This included criticism of Zegler's own remarks about the original film, where she stated she was not a fan of the original \"Snow White\" and found the prince to be \"weird and stalker-y.\" Additionally, the film faced backlash for its casting choices and a perceived \"backward portrayal\" of people with dwarfism, with actor Peter Dinklage voicing concerns. Zegler's comments and her \"Free Palestine\" tweet reportedly caused friction with producers and led to increased security measures for co-star Gal Gadot due to threats. There have also been rumors and reports of Zegler potentially suing Disney for alleged defamation and breach of contract, though it's unclear if any lawsuits have been formally filed. Some reports also suggest Disney is preparing legal action against Zegler for promotional sabotage.\n\nFurthermore, Zegler has been accused by some of having \"disturbing behavior\" behind the scenes and of alienating fans and co-stars.

One notable lawsuit involved a class action complaint filed in April 2022, alleging that Uniswap and its associated entities facilitated \"rampant fraud\" and offered unregistered securities. This lawsuit was dismissed by a judge who ruled that software cannot be held accountable for user losses. However, on February 26, 2025, an appeals court reinstated the plaintiffs' state law claims in this case, which alleges that Uniswap and Adams aided and abetted fraud by allowing the Uniswap Interface to be used for trading scam tokens.\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed by Ric Burton, an early supporter of Uniswap, who sued Adams for breach of contract, claiming he was unfairly enriched at Burton's expense. Burton also alleged he was denied an opportunity to invest in Uniswap during its initial funding rounds. Adams, however, claimed the case was dismissed.\n\nMore recently, in April 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned Uniswap Labs that it was preparing to recommend charges against the company for operating an unregistered securities exchange and broker. Adams stated he was prepared to fight these charges, even taking the case to the Supreme Court, and expressed confidence in the legality of Uniswap's products.\n\nAdams has also publicly addressed allegations of bribery related to protocol deployments on the Uniswap platform, which he denied, clarifying that such decisions are based on governance voting, not payments.

This suit alleges that Jump Trading illegally profited from Terra's collapse through secret deals with Terraform Labs, including receiving heavily discounted LUNA tokens in exchange for defending the UST peg. The lawsuit claims Jump Trading manipulated the market for UST and aUST, and later resold LUNA tokens for over $1.28 billion in profit.\n\nFurthermore, Kariya reportedly pleaded the Fifth Amendment hundreds of times during an SEC deposition when questioned about these alleged back-door deals. A class-action complaint also alleges that Kariya and Terraform Labs' Do Kwon reassured investors about UST's stability without disclosing Jump Trading's intervention, leading investors to believe the algorithm alone had restored the peg. Kariya appeared on a Jump Crypto podcast with Do Kwon, where Kwon allegedly misrepresented the self-healing capabilities of UST, and Kariya failed to correct these misleading statements.\n\nThese allegations are part of broader scrutiny of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, which has seen several honorees face legal troubles, including accusations of fraud and other financial misconduct."}, {"year": "2023", "name": "Kate Dunbar", "age": "26", "title": "MACRO RESEARCH TEAM LEAD", "company": "BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES", "category": "Finance", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2023", "name": "Kendall Jager", "age": "27", "title": "DATA SCIENTIST", "company": "MILLENNIUM MANAGEMENT", "category": "Finance", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2023", "name": "Kevin Sekniqi", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER", "company": "AVA LABS", "category": "Finance", "description": "", "fraud": "In August 2022, a report from Crypto Leaks alleged that Ava Labs, the company co-founded by Kevin Sekniqi, paid the law firm Roche Freedman to file lawsuits against its competitors.

These individuals were identified as Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay's CEO, and Mouna Ammari Siala, MoonPay's CFO.

In addition to the doping controversy, Richardson was arrested in July 2025 on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge following an alleged verbal and physical altercation with her partner, Christian Coleman. Although Coleman declined medical attention and refused to press charges, police proceeded with the arrest based on probable cause."}, {"year": "2024", "name": "Kelly Sherman", "age": "28", "title": "AGENT", "company": "WME SPORTS", "category": "Sports", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2024", "name": "Sophia Smith", "age": "23", "title": "FORWARD", "company": "U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM", "category": "Sports", "description": "", "fraud": "Sophia Smith, a prominent player for the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, has been involved in controversies related to officiating and team performance. In one instance, she publicly criticized the NWSL for fining teammate Alex Morgan over a rant about refereeing, stating that the league's priorities were \"all messed up\". Smith also expressed her frustration with NWSL referees by posting a video of a controversial offside call against her team, questioning the league's judgment.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Women's National Team's victory in the Olympics was marked by controversy, as Sophia Smith appeared to be in an offside position during the game-winning goal. Brazil protested the play, arguing that Smith interfered with the play, but the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) did not review the decision.\n\nWhile there are no direct lawsuits or scandals targeting Sophia Smith personally, the U.S. Soccer Federation has faced broader investigations and player advocacy for better conditions and treatment, which she has supported. It is important to note that a different individual, Joanna Smith-Griffin, a Forbes \"30 Under 30\" honoree, has been arrested and charged with fraud.

challenges related to his company's operations, particularly concerning the alleged facilitation of cryptocurrency scams. While these issues primarily target the company, Mintz, as its leader, is associated with them.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed against Bitcoin Depot. In Iowa, the Attorney General investigated the company, finding that a significant portion of transactions on their ATMs were linked to scams, totaling millions of dollars. This led to legal action, with Bitcoin Depot accused of profiting from these fraudulent transactions and failing to adequately protect consumers. Another lawsuit involves a scam victim suing Bitcoin Depot, alleging that both the company and the hosting retailers should be held responsible. A federal judge has sent at least one of these cases to arbitration.\n\nMintz himself has publicly commented on regulations aimed at curbing crypto ATM scams. He has argued that new laws, such as one in California limiting daily transactions and fees, create economic challenges for his company and may not be the most effective way to prevent scams. He has also stated that Bitcoin Depot takes measures to prevent scams, including on-screen warnings and customer verifications.\n\nWhile Mintz was recognized by Forbes \"30 Under 30,\" investigations and lawsuits suggest a pattern where Bitcoin Depot's ATMs have been used in a high percentage of scam-related transactions, with accusations that the company profits from these activities."}, {"year":

Tristan Semmelhack", "age": "28, 23", "title": "COFOUNDERS, REFLECT ORBITAL", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "As of early 2026, **Ben Nowack** and **Tristan Semmelhack**, the co-founders of **Reflect Orbital** (formerly **Tons of Mirrors**), have not been targeted by any known lawsuits, criminal scandals, or fraud indictments. However, their company and technology have been the subject of significant **technical and environmental controversy**.\n\nKey points regarding the controversies include:\n\n*   **Technical Skepticism and \"Scam\" Allegations:** Since the company's emergence, prominent figures in the engineering and science communities have publicly questioned the feasibility of their \"sunlight-as-a-service\" model. Most notably, **Dave Jones** of the **EEVblog** published a widely-shared \"debunking\" video in September 2024, arguing that the physics of reflecting sunlight from small satellites to achieve the claimed intensity (200 watts/m\u00b2) is economically and technically unfeasible. This has led to accusations on social media and engineering forums that the project is an \"investor scam\" designed to generate hype without a workable product.\n*   **Marketing Controversies:** In mid-2024, Reflect Orbital released a viral video showing a \"demonstration\" of their service, where an app user \"orders\" sunlight that appears to beam down on a specific location. The video faced immediate backlash for being misleading, as the company had no satellites in orbit at the time. Ben Nowack later clarified on social media that the video was a \"simple demonstration\" intended to show the user experience, rather than actual orbital reflection, which skeptics labeled as deceptive marketing.\n*   **Environmental and Astronomical Opposition:** The advocacy group **DarkSky International** and various astronomical organizations have formally opposed the project. They argue that a constellation of mirrored satellites would cause severe light pollution, disrupt nocturnal ecosystems, interfere with astronomical research, and potentially create safety hazards for aviation and ground-based observers.\n*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The company has been in the process of seeking licenses from the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** for a demonstration satellite (targeted for 2026). While this is a standard regulatory step, it has become a focal point for public comment and opposition from those concerned about space debris and light pollution.\n\nIn summary, while there is no legal or criminal \"scandal\" associated with the founders, their business concept is a major point of public and scientific debate."}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Raj Lulla, Namin Shah, Dante Vaisbort", "age": "24, 24, 25", "title": "COFOUNDERS, HAYLON TECHNOLOGIES", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Vignesh Karthik, Connor Lee, Ankit Singhal", "age": "20, 21, 20", "title": "COFOUNDERS, ANTHROGEN", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Fabia Farlin Athena", "age": "28", "title": "FELLOW, STANFORD UNIVERSITY", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Justin Hardin, Jesse Hynes", "age": "29, 28", "title": "COFOUNDERS, CLIMATEBASE", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Kip Daujotas", "age": "25", "title": "INVESTMENT ASSOCIATE, ARAMCO VENTURES", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Leopold Dobelle", "age": "28", "title": "COFOUNDER, MITICO", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Sanjana Paul, Bhargav Sathish", "age": "27, 27", "title": "COFOUNDERS, EARTH HACKS", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Elliott Bennett, Dylan Lew, Kyle Wyche", "age": "25, 26, 28", "title": "COFOUNDERS, ECOTONE RENEWABLES", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Hannah Friedman", "age": "28", "title": "FOUNDING PRINCIPAL, PLANETEER CAPITAL", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Adam Uliana", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER, CHEMFINITY TECHNOLOGIES", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Mohammad Alkhadra", "age": "29", "title": "FOUNDER, LITHIOS", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Max Gangestad", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER, GROSS-WEN TECHNOLOGIES", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Wenting Gao", "age": "29", "title": "PARTNER, MCKINSEY", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Gizem Karagoz", "age": "29", "title": "SENIOR PROJECT MANAGER, NEW YORK CITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Maxwell L'Etoile", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER, ALUMINIO", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2025", "name": "Grace Lam", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER, NETA", "company": "", "category": "energy-green-tech", "description": "", "fraud": "Grace Lam, a Forbes 30 Under 30 winner, has been involved in a few controversies and personal issues.

CVMR (2025):** In January 2025, Long and Westwin Elements filed a lawsuit against **Chemical Vapor Metal Refining (CVMR)** and its founder, Kamran Khozan. Long alleged that CVMR acted as a \"Canadian con artist\" operation that defrauded her company of $3 million for a feasibility study that was never delivered.\n*   **Counterclaim Alleging Misrepresentation:** In March 2025, CVMR filed a counterclaim against Long and Westwin. The suit alleged that Long was \"inexperienced, unsophisticated, and unqualified\" and that she had made \"intentional and material misrepresentations\" during their dealings. Khozan specifically claimed that Long had misrepresented her company\u2019s revenue and touted her political connections to secure the partnership.\n\n### **Project Controversies**\n*   **Bryan County, Georgia (2026):** In early 2026, Long faced intense local opposition regarding a proposed nickel refinery in Richmond Hill, Georgia. Residents and county officials expressed \"mounting skepticism\" over the company's lack of transparency and past project failures (such as an abandoned refinery project in Lawton, Oklahoma).\n*   **\"Frivolous\" Cease-and-Desist:** In February 2026, Westwin sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bryan County Chairman Carter Infinger over statements he made about the project.

These actions led to multiple lawsuits, including a federal lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Lloyd's conduct also prompted a call for an investigation by the Virginia State Bar for alleged violations of professional conduct rules.\n\nReports indicate that Lloyd personally intervened to dissuade minors from obtaining abortions, sometimes directing them to \"crisis pregnancy centers\" instead of comprehensive healthcare providers. His actions were described as cruelly imposing his anti-abortion views on young women. In one instance, a federal court ruled that Lloyd violated the Constitution by refusing to let an undocumented minor obtain an abortion. He was also accused of violating the terms of a settlement agreement regarding the rights of unaccompanied immigrant minors and potentially committing contempt of court.\n\nWhile Lloyd claimed these reports were untrue and that he remained the decision-maker until November 2018, he was effectively removed from his role amid these controversies. He later resigned from the Front Royal Town Council, citing potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIt is important to note that the \"Scott Lloyd\" mentioned in the context of Forbes 30 Under 30 in the prompt is likely different from the Scott Lloyd discussed in the search results, as the Forbes 30 Under 30 list mentioned in the search results pertains to a \"Scott Lloyd\" in Marketing & Advertising for 2026, while the controversies detailed above are linked to a Scott Lloyd who served as the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Given the prompt's focus on negative information, the detailed controversies surrounding the ORR director are the most relevant findings.\n\nTherefore, the information regarding the Scott Lloyd in the search results indicates he was targeted by lawsuits, public outcry, and calls for investigation due to his actions as ORR director."}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Sydney Thomas", "age": "29", "title": "DIRECTOR, BRAND MARKETING, BEIS", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Mary Grace Scully", "age": "28", "title": "HEAD OF MARKETING, LOCKER", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Jack Sloane", "age": "23", "title": "STRATEGIC TALENT & COLLABORATION MANAGER, LA KINGS", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Audrey Steele", "age": "26", "title": "FOUNDER, STEELE PR", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Jordan Davis, Noah Palansky", "age": "28, 29", "title": "COFOUNDERS, TAIV", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Brennan Tobin", "age": "28", "title": "FOUNDER, ODDDUCK MARKETING GROUP", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Jen Yuan", "age": "29", "title": "COFOUNDER, VIEW SOURCE", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Nima Zaribaf", "age": "29", "title": "GLOBAL SVP, BRAND & COMMUNICATIONS, AMIRI", "company": "", "category": "marketing-advertising", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Devon Gethers, Karlton Haney", "age": "29, 27", "title": "COFOUNDERS, MERIDIAN VENTURES", "company": "", "category": "venture-capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Cici Bellis", "age": "26", "title": "FOUNDER, CARTAN CAPITAL", "company": "", "category": "venture-capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Eunice Ajim", "age": "29", "title": "FOUNDING PARTNER, AJIM CAPITAL", "company": "", "category": "venture-capital", "description": "", "fraud": "N/A"}, {"year": "2026", "name": "Eugenia Bejar", "age": "29", "title": "VICE PRESIDENT, INSIGHT PARTNERS", "company": "", "category": "venture-capital", "description": "", "fraud": "Eugenia Bejar is not mentioned in any of the search results regarding lawsuits, scandals, or controversies.
