2018,Francis Davidson,25,Cofounders,Sonder,Consumer Technology,,"Sonder, the company co-founded by Forbes 30 under 30 winner Francis Davidson, has faced multiple lawsuits and significant controversy surrounding its collapse.

The company is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging that its financial statements contained material errors regarding the valuation and impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets, necessitating restatements of previously issued financial statements. Landlords in New York have also sued Sonder, claiming the company breached its lease contracts and caused chaos by abruptly closing its properties, leaving guests stranded and belongings inaccessible. These landlords are seeking substantial damages.

Furthermore, a former employee filed a class-action suit alleging that Sonder failed to provide adequate warning of mass layoffs before filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, violating the WARN Act. Reports also indicate that Marriott terminated its partnership with Sonder due to a default, leading to the abrupt closure of Sonder's operations and leaving guests with little notice to vacate. Accusations have also surfaced regarding Sonder's leadership potentially threatening to lock out guests as leverage for emergency funds. Francis Davidson himself announced his departure from the company in June 2025, stating that ""What unfolded over the following years was far worse than anything we'd seen in historical data or ever imagined was possible""."

The lawsuit alleges that xAI's chatbot, Grok, was used to create nude and sexually explicit images of St. Clair without her consent, using her altered photographs. She claims that xAI did not comply with her requests to stop generating and remove these images. In response, xAI filed its own suit, asserting that St. Clair violated their terms of service by filing her lawsuit in New York instead of the designated federal court in Texas. St. Clair's lawsuit reportedly uses older legal doctrines to address harms caused by new AI technology."

This association led to questions about his real estate startup, Cadre, particularly concerning the disclosure of stakes and the potential implications for construction permits and property sales. In 2015, Kushner Companies filed paperwork with New York City falsely stating that no rent-regulated tenants lived in certain Queens apartments when applying for construction permits. Bloomberg News later suggested that the resale of these properties in 2017 might have been less profitable if proper disclosures had been made. Cadre stated that it was unaware of the issue and that administrative filings were the responsibility of its operating partners, Kushner Companies, which in turn claimed its filings were prepared by third parties. There is no information suggesting Ryan Williams himself was directly involved in any lawsuits, scandals, or controversies beyond these association-related concerns."

The other lawsuit involves authors and news outlets, including The New York Times, accusing OpenAI of copyright infringement. In this case, Brockman's personal journal is being sought as evidence to determine if OpenAI's training of AI models on copyrighted works constitutes fair use or illegal copying. Additionally, OpenAI itself has filed a trademark infringement and fraud lawsuit against an identically named company, with Brockman and Altman named in counterclaims."

In November 2023, an early Ethereum insider, Steven Nerayoff, made allegations of corruption and fraud against Vitalik Buterin, releasing recordings from 2015 that he claimed revealed flaws in Ethereum's early financial management and leadership.

Additionally, in April 2020, Craig Wright, who claims to be the inventor of Bitcoin, abandoned a libel lawsuit against Vitalik Buterin. Wright had previously threatened to sue crypto leaders who questioned his claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto.

There was also a class-action lawsuit filed in September 2022 concerning EthereumMax (EMAX Tokens), which alleged that the company misled investors by associating itself with the Ethereum network. The lawsuit noted that Vitalik Buterin had publicly called for Kim Kardashian to be ""canceled"" for promoting EMAX Tokens.

Furthermore, in 2022, Vitalik Buterin received backlash for his suggestion on Twitter regarding a solution to the gender pay gap, proposing ""synthetic wombs.""

In relation to T-Mobile, Vitalik Buterin's X account was hacked via a SIM-swap attack, leading to an increase in lawsuits against T-Mobile for similar security breaches.

The SEC has also been involved in enforcement actions within the crypto industry, suing major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. While not directly suing Buterin, these actions have implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem, and Buterin has offered his perspective on these regulatory moves."

2018,Mark Fischbach,28,YouTuber,Markiplier,Games,,"Mark Fischbach, widely known as Markiplier, has faced several controversies and scandals throughout his career. These include allegations of antifeminism, a Snapchat controversy in 2015 where a fan accused him of taking advantage of her and keeping screenshots of nude photos (which Fischbach admitted to but denied taking screenshots), and accusations of offending the transgender community. More recently, there has been discussion surrounding the use of AI in content creation, with fans expressing concerns about authenticity and ownership. Fischbach has also faced backlash regarding his business ventures, such as his clothing line Cloak, due to pricing and perceived simplistic design. Additionally, there was a controversy in 2016 when his channel was hacked, leaking his monthly income. In 2023, his film ""Iron Lung"" faced scrutiny when it was compared to the real-life implosion of a submersible, and later, its removal from box office charts caused further discussion."
2018,Sabina Foisor,28,Woman Grandmaster,US Chess Federation,Games,,"A controversy arose during a chess match between Sabina Foisor and Monika Soćko. In a crucial tiebreak game, Foisor reached a drawn endgame with only kings and knights remaining. Although she ran out of time, the arbiter initially ruled it a draw. However, Soćko appealed, arguing that checkmate, while not immediately forced, was still possible. The appeal was successful, leading to Soćko's victory and Foisor's elimination from the tournament. There are no other prominent lawsuits, scandals, or controversies directly involving Sabina Foisor mentioned in the search results."
2018,Toby Fox,26,Designer,,Games,,"There was a controversy surrounding Toby Fox and the music rights for the fangame *Undertale Yellow*. Sebastian Wolff, CEO of Materia Music (which manages media rights for *Undertale*), raised concerns about the soundtrack being uploaded to streaming services, despite Toby Fox's general leniency with fan projects. This led to some songs being removed from streaming platforms and caused an outcry among fans who felt Wolff's actions were condescending and out of touch with Fox's stance. Additionally, Toby Fox was indirectly brought into a controversy involving Omocat, the artist for *Undertale*. This involved past problematic tweets by Omocat, and Fox was mentioned in comparisons, although the reasoning for dragging him into it was questioned. There are also discussions about the legality of soundfonts used in *Undertale's* music, with some questioning if Fox had proper permissions or if it constituted copyright infringement. A music YouTuber also accused Fox of plagiarism, which was refuted by others who stated that all songs were properly credited and no plagiarism occurred."

He later apologized for his statements, acknowledging that he let an ""onset conflict cloud my judgment"" and expressed deep regret for his words.

Additionally, in late 2023, Booster was misidentified in articles by *The Hollywood Reporter* and *Out Magazine*, who used his photo when referring to comedian Bowen Yang. Booster and others called out the publications for their errors, with some suggesting the mistakes were racially motivated."

2018,Charlie Kirk,24,Founder and Executive Director,Turning Point USA,Law & Policy,,"Charlie Kirk, who was recognized by Forbes in their 2018 ""30 Under 30"" list for Law & Policy, has been associated with several controversies and legal issues involving his organization, Turning Point USA (TPUSA).

Turning Point Action, an affiliate of TPUSA, was fined $18,000 by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for failing to disclose donors. This fine stemmed from a complaint filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), alleging that TPUSA Action failed to report over $33,000 in contributions intended to influence the 2020 election.

Additionally, a former TPUSA employee alleged that the organization shared personal information of over 700 student supporters with an employee of Marco Rubio's presidential campaign. There have also been concerns raised by tax experts regarding whether TPUSA's conduct during a pro-Donald Trump event in 2016 may have violated its tax-exempt status, though TPUSA disputed these claims.

Furthermore, TPUSA has been criticized for its role in promoting misinformation, including claims about the 2020 election results, COVID-19 vaccines, and other topics. The organization has also faced scrutiny for its fundraising practices, including the use of ""dark money"" operations to keep donors' identities secret.

More recently, there have been attempts to trademark the name ""Turning Point USA"" and ""Charlie Kirk"" by individuals seeking to profit from Kirk's legacy, especially after his death. There has also been controversy surrounding an AI-generated song, ""We Are Charlie Kirk,"" which was criticized for its potentially extremist propaganda."

Tubbs stated he felt threatened and denied filing a false police report.

Additionally, during his 2020 reelection campaign, Tubbs was the target of a ""targeted disinformation assault"" by a fake-news website called the 209 Times. The website spread misinformation, allegedly preying on racial biases, and is believed to have contributed to his election loss. Tubbs himself has spoken about experiencing a ""four-year disinformation campaign"" during his time as mayor. In 2014, Tubbs was arrested for driving under the influence and pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges, for which he apologized."

She was accused of lying about her company's user base to secure a $175 million acquisition by the bank. Specifically, Javice claimed Frank had over 4.25 million users, when in reality, it had fewer than 300,000. Federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against her in 2023, accusing her of repeatedly inflating customer numbers to fraudulently induce the bank to buy the company. JPMorgan Chase sued her after discovering that the reported user database was largely fabricated. This case has been compared to that of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes."

Halo sued CDI Furniture and Ouaknine for intellectual property infringement, including copyright, patent, and trademark rights. A jury found in favor of Halo, determining that CDI willfully infringed on two design patents, the ODEON trademark, and nine copyrights. The jury awarded Halo damages totaling over $1.5 million for patent and trademark infringement, and an additional $2.5 million for copyright infringement. An email exchange from 2013 indicated that Ouaknine was warned about Halo's copyrights by a supplier, yet CDI continued to sell the infringing Mars Chair. The case involved legal arguments about forum non conveniens, with the Federal Circuit eventually reversing a lower court's dismissal and remanding the case for further proceedings."

The lawsuit alleges that company executives, including Russell, made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information. Specifically, the suit claims that Russell engaged in undisclosed conduct that prompted an inquiry by Luminar's Audit Committee, creating a risk that he would be removed from his positions. This situation allegedly impacted the company's business by making it harder to compete, manage research and development, and retain customers, and also negatively affected Luminar's brand and standing in the industry. The lawsuit further contends that Luminar had no reasonable basis to maintain its financial guidance during the period in question, leading to artificially inflated stock prices and subsequent investor losses when the truth emerged."

2018,Nina Yiamsamatha,29,Product Marketing Manager,Instagram,Marketing & Advertising,,"Charlie Javice, who was recognized on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list in 2019 for her student financial planning startup Frank, has been at the center of a significant lawsuit and fraud scandal. She was accused of defrauding JP Morgan Chase by misrepresenting the number of users her company had to convince the bank to acquire it for $175 million. Prosecutors allege that Frank had fewer than 300,000 users, while Javice claimed it had 4.25 million.

This alleged deception led to JP Morgan firing Javice, shutting down Frank in early 2023, and subsequently suing her for fraud. Javice, in turn, sued JP Morgan for legal costs and for terminating her before she could receive a $20 million retention bonus. She was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges and sentenced to seven years and one month in prison in September 2025, though she remains out on bail while appealing her conviction. The legal fees associated with the case are reported to be over $100 million, which a clause in her contract required JP Morgan to cover."

Edwards filed a lawsuit against his former employer, First Trust, alleging retaliatory termination for whistleblowing activities under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank Act. This case involved disputes over expert witness reports and jury demands.

Additionally, Dr. Aaron Edwards, a theology lecturer, was sacked by Cliff College following a controversial tweet he made about homosexuality. This led to a legal battle where he claimed unfair dismissal, harassment, and discrimination. An employment tribunal initially dismissed his claims, but Edwards intended to appeal the ruling. He stated that the controversy had a significant impact on him and his family, including moving out of their home and relying on crowdfunding.

Furthermore, a separate legal case from 2012 involved a $15 million payment by Lee Memorial Health System due to alleged negligence concerning a patient named Aaron Edwards, who was born with cerebral palsy."

In 2017, Kaczynski, as part of CNN's KFile team, reported on a Reddit user who created an anti-CNN video meme. While Kaczynski's reporting identified the user, CNN initially stated they would not reveal the identity because the user was a private citizen who had apologized. However, CNN added a disclaimer that they reserved the right to publish the identity if circumstances changed, which led to accusations of blackmail. Conversely, some criticized the article for not revealing the user's name. Kaczynski stated that the disclaimer was misinterpreted and that the user had not been threatened before issuing the apology. This reporting also led to the resignation of several Trump administration officials in 2017 and 2018 due to controversial comments Kaczynski uncovered."
2018,Rupi Kaur,25,Author,,Media,,"Rupi Kaur has faced controversies and criticisms throughout her career. One notable issue includes plagiarism claims, with another poet, Nayyirah Waheed, accusing Kaur of similarities in their work and of not responding to her concerns. Kaur has denied these allegations.

Additionally, her book ""Milk and Honey"" has been challenged and flagged for removal in school districts in Texas, with the reason cited being its exploration of sexual assault and violence. This has led to discussions about book banning and the accessibility of literature for children.

Kaur's style of poetry, often referred to as ""Instapoetry,"" has also drawn criticism, with some arguing that it is too simplistic or lacks the depth of traditional poetry. Her recognition as ""writer of the decade"" by The New Republic in 2019 sparked debate about the merit of her work and the evolving landscape of poetry."

While he had been granted a U.S. visa, his entry was blocked, and his Syrian passport was reportedly canceled by the Syrian regime.

There is no information available in the search results about any lawsuits, other scandals, or controversies directly involving Khaled Khatib beyond the U.S. entry ban. It is important to note that other individuals with similar names, such as Fadi El-Khatib (a basketball player) and Souhair Khatib (involved in a lawsuit regarding religious attire), have faced legal issues or controversies, but these are distinct from Khaled Khatib's situation. Additionally, there are discussions about other Forbes 30 Under 30 alumni facing legal troubles, but these do not directly relate to Khaled Khatib."

The FPF, as a shareholder, has criticized this settlement, calling it a ""thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system"" and a potential violation of the First Amendment. The foundation argues that such a settlement could expose Paramount executives to liability for bribery, especially given the context of Paramount seeking approval for a merger with Skydance Media. The FPF has also issued warnings that a settlement could set a dangerous precedent for press freedom and embolden further targeting of news outlets."

More recently, in 2021, Olivia Rodrigo retroactively added Hayley Williams and Josh Farro as co-writers to her song ""good 4 u,"" following accusations that it was similar to Paramore's 2007 single ""Misery Business."" This led to Rodrigo reportedly paying millions in royalties to Paramore. This situation sparked a debate about copyright infringement and inspiration in music.

There was also a controversy in 2010 where former Paramore members, the Farro brothers, accused Williams and her father (who was the band's tour manager) of creating a toxic work environment. They claimed that Williams' father would threaten to ""pull the plug"" on the band if they complained, and that Williams herself had a ""spiritual drift away from Christianity,"" which they disagreed with regarding some of the band's lyrics.

Additionally, in 2024, there were allegations of a toxic work environment at a hair salon founded by Williams in Nashville. Williams responded to these allegations, with some sources suggesting she was being scapegoated due to her fame.

In February 2026, Kenworthy posted an image with the words ""f*** ice"" seemingly urinated into the snow, along with a message urging citizens to pressure senators to deny funding for the agency. He stated, ""Innocent people have been murdered, and enough is enough. We can't wait around while ICE continues to operate with unchecked power in our communities"". This action occurred ahead of the Winter Olympics in Italy and amid protests against ICE. While Kenworthy was outspoken at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, criticizing China's human rights record and its stance on LGBT issues, this particular post did not involve Team GB and was made outside the Olympic environment, so British Olympic Association officials were reportedly unconcerned. There is no information indicating that Gus Kenworthy has been targeted by any lawsuits."

One notable instance involved his comments about athletes being pushed to be activists, particularly in relation to Pride jerseys. Subban stated that while people can support the LGBTQ+ community, athletes should not be compelled to wear specific attire to show that support, leading to a divided reaction within the hockey community.

Additionally, during his time with the Nashville Predators, there were reports that Subban was silenced by the team for violating team rules related to a partnership with Listerine.

Subban has also been a target of racist remarks and taunts, which he has spoken out against. He has emphasized the need to stop racist language in sports. There have been discussions and accusations of racism playing a role in the criticism he has faced from fans, media, and even within the hockey establishment.

Some have also speculated about the reasons behind his trades, with theories suggesting personality clashes or team policies as contributing factors. While not a lawsuit or scandal in the traditional sense, these instances highlight controversies and criticisms Subban has encountered."

He was disqualified from the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary for the 2026 Ekiti State governorship election due to alleged irregularities in his nomination process, specifically a failure to secure the required number of valid nominators per Local Government Area.

Prior to his disqualification, Ojo had been the subject of petitions accusing him of non-compliance, invalid nominators, missing signatures, and failing to meet requirements. His team responded to these petitions with documented proof and legal arguments, and he was initially cleared by a screening committee.

There were also allegations of political sabotage against him, with claims that his adversaries attempted to prevent him from obtaining and submitting his nomination form. Additionally, Ojo accused Governor Biodun Oyebanji of turning the APC into his ""private estate"" and threatening local party leaders to exclude rivals, which Ojo deemed unconstitutional and undemocratic. Reports also emerged of Ojo being arrested on fabricated charges and subjected to unlawful detention and harassment, which his camp reported to the police."

The user claims that after withdrawing from the program within the trial period, Pathrise repeatedly assured them that their loan would be canceled, only to later state they had no authority to do so and that the debt was now the user's responsibility. This user also expressed a hope that these allegations would tarnish the names of Kevin Wu and Derrick Mar before they could start new ventures. The post further states that the loan was transferred from Edly to AES, and the user filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

It is important to note that Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list has been associated with several honorees who have faced legal issues, including fraud charges. However, there is no direct mention of Derrick Mar himself being personally targeted by a lawsuit, suing, scandal, or controversy outside of the allegations within the Pathrise context."

Some media reports questioned the value and substance of Unfiltered, with one journalist noting that the interviews weren't truly ""unfiltered"" as subjects had creative control over the edits. There were also discussions about whether Millar conducted himself poorly, with suggestions that in the US, he might have faced lawsuits for organizing the sale of the business without majority shareholder approval and using company funds for personal expenses. Despite these controversies, the reporting also highlights that Millar was a charismatic figure who actively courted media attention. His death in 2021 at the age of 26 led to discussions about media coverage of entrepreneurs and the pressures of the startup world."

2019,Joy Buolamwini,28,Founder,Algorithmic Justice League,Enterprise Technology,,"Yes, Joy Buolamwini has been involved in controversies and faced scrutiny, primarily related to her work on algorithmic bias in artificial intelligence.

*   **Google Gemini Controversy:** In 2024, Buolamwini commented on a controversy surrounding Google's Gemini AI model. Users observed that the text-to-image feature generated historically inaccurate images, such as a Black pope or diverse depictions of the ""founding fathers."" Buolamwini advocated for nuance and continuous adaptation in addressing algorithmic bias and discrimination issues in AI.
*   **Algorithmic Bias Research:** Buolamwini's research has consistently highlighted significant racial and gender biases in facial recognition software. Her work has shown that these systems perform less accurately on darker-skinned individuals and women, leading to potential harms like wrongful arrests. For example, she highlighted the cases of Robert Williams and Portia Woodruff, who were victims of facial recognition errors. This research has drawn attention to the ethical implications of AI and has led to advocacy for greater accountability in the tech industry.
*   **DumpID.me Petition:** In 2022, the Algorithmic Justice League, co-founded by Buolamwini, collaborated on a petition called DumpID.me. This petition called for the IRS to stop using ID.me, a facial recognition technology, for user logins. The IRS eventually agreed to halt the program."

She was accused of inflating the number of users her company had to fraudulently induce JP Morgan to acquire Frank for $175 million. The alleged deception was discovered when JP Morgan's attempt to contact Frank's customers resulted in a significantly lower response rate than expected. Javice was subsequently fired by JP Morgan, and the company shut down Frank. Following this, JP Morgan sued Javice for fraud, and she countersued for legal costs and a retention bonus. In 2023, federal prosecutors also filed criminal charges against her. The case has drawn comparisons to the Theranos scandal and Elizabeth Holmes."

A wealthy New York family, the Mukamals, has sued Bitwise for alleged fraud and mismanagement. The lawsuit claims that Bitwise executives, including CEO Hunter Horsley, fraudulently deceived investors by selling a crypto fund as a private investment opportunity and then converting it to an over-the-counter (OTC) trading model without proper disclosure. The Mukamals allege that this conversion and subsequent actions led to significant financial losses, with claims of a ""reckless and negligent pump and dump"" scheme. Bitwise has denied the allegations and intends to dispute the charges. Additionally, there was criticism directed at Hunter Horsley from Ethereum enthusiasts following Bitwise's endorsement of Solana, though this appears to be a difference in opinion within the crypto community rather than a legal action."

Chalamet was reportedly ""upset"" about being compelled to donate money he received from his role in Woody Allen's ""A Rainy Day in New York.""
*   **Controversial remarks on parenthood:** Chalamet made comments in a Vogue interview about finding it ""bleak"" when people brag about not having children, which led to backlash from some netizens who found his remarks ""icky.""
*   **Accusations on Twitter:** In 2020, there were accusations circulating on Twitter regarding sexual misconduct on a film set when Chalamet was 19 years old. The details and classification of these accusations were unclear, and some discussions questioned whether they would be considered sexual assault or misconduct.
*   **Fake Chlamydia Scandal:** A rumor spread online, originating from a secondhand story shared on Twitter, claiming Chalamet spread chlamydia across the NYU campus in 2015. This rumor is speculative and has not been confirmed by Chalamet.
*   **Allegations of Infidelity:** In early 2026, speculation arose regarding Chalamet's relationship with Kylie Jenner, fueled by a video of him with model Anamaria Vartolomei in a Paris hotel lobby.
*   **Use of a homophobic slur:** In 2016, Chalamet was asked to read a homophobic slur in a play, which led to online criticism and the hashtag #TimotheeChalametIsOverParty trending."

2019,Alyssa Lanz,28,Agent,United Talent Agency,Hollywood & Entertainment,,"Charlie Javice, a Forbes ""30 Under 30"" honoree and founder of the fintech startup Frank, is facing a lawsuit from JPMorgan Chase. The bank alleges that Javice defrauded them by inflating the number of customers her company had to secure a $175 million acquisition. JPMorgan claims that Javice fabricated a list of over 4 million fake users to convince them to buy Frank, when in reality, the company had fewer than 300,000 customers. Federal prosecutors have also filed criminal charges against Javice for repeatedly making false claims about Frank's customer base. Her case has drawn comparisons to that of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and she has been included in discussions about a ""Forbes 30 Under 30 curse"" due to other individuals from that list who have faced legal troubles. Javice has denied the allegations."

This lawsuit was requested to be dropped by Sheridan's legal team just one month later.

Additionally, the movie ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" in which Tye Sheridan appeared, faced controversy regarding its promotional billboards. These billboards depicted the character Apocalypse choking Mystique, which critics argued advocated violence against women."

One notable controversy involved allegations of questionable spending practices by his PAC, ""Leaders We Deserve,"" with reports suggesting that a significant portion of the funds raised was not allocated to supporting liberal candidates. There were also criticisms regarding his primary initiative to spend $20 million on electing younger politicians over established Democratic incumbents.

Furthermore, Hogg's election as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was challenged by a losing candidate who claimed the election process was flawed and discriminated against female candidates. This led to a review of the election results by the DNC's Credentials Committee. A Justice Department official even encouraged Hogg to file a civil rights report concerning the election challenge. Ultimately, Hogg announced he would not run in a planned redo of the DNC vice chair elections.

Additionally, Hogg and other survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, who founded the #NeverAgain movement, faced criticism from some political figures, with one commentator calling Hogg an ""idiot"" for allegedly exploiting the tragedy.

2019,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,29,Democratic Nominee,US House of Representatives,Law & Policy,,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has faced legal challenges and ethical scrutiny during her time in public office. In 2019, two lawsuits were filed against her, alleging that blocking critics on her Twitter account violated the First Amendment. These suits were filed in the wake of a Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that determined President Trump's practice of blocking critics on Twitter was unconstitutional.

Additionally, in 2019, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint was filed, alleging that Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign manager operated a ""subsidy scheme"" that violated campaign finance laws. This complaint was later the subject of a lawsuit filed by a government watchdog group against the FEC in 2022, after the commission dismissed the original complaint.

In 2021, an ethics complaint was filed against Ocasio-Cortez regarding her attendance at the Met Gala. The complaint claimed her ticket was an illegal gift. In 2025, the House Ethics Committee found that she had violated House rules by not paying the full value for her attire and for improperly accepting free admission for her fiancé, ordering her to pay approximately $3,000 to settle the matter."

During a legislative session in June 2021, Powell attempted to introduce an amendment to ban biological males from competing in female sports. This amendment was met with loud objections, including desk pounding and shouting, from Democratic representatives. The ""Save Women's Sports Act"" she sponsored aims to prevent transgender girls and women from participating in women's high school and college sports. This language was later passed as part of House Bill 68, which was in the midst of a veto dispute between the governor and the state legislature.

Wylie's revelations led to the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which prompted multiple government investigations and raised widespread concerns about data privacy and the vulnerability of democratic processes to disinformation. His actions caused a temporary decline in Facebook's market value and spurred stricter regulations on social media and data collection.

Wylie himself was sued by Cambridge Analytica and forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement after he left the company upon realizing the negative societal impact of its activities. Despite these challenges, Wylie has continued to speak out about the dangers of data manipulation and has written a book detailing his experiences.

In March 2025, VA Secretary Doug Collins brought up a $5 million defamation lawsuit that CNN had settled with a Navy veteran when Kaitlan Collins repeatedly questioned him about a national security leak. He accused CNN of being ""hostile"" toward veterans and suggested the network had a problem with them.

She also faced backlash in February 2025 for a tweet that shared a link to the legal defense website of Luigi Mangione, a man accused of murder. Critics accused her of promoting a fundraiser for a killer, leading to her deleting the tweet and reportedly clashing with CNN bosses.

Additionally, former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Collins on multiple occasions. In one instance, he confronted her during a meeting, dismissing her question about a deportation controversy and accusing CNN of bias. Trump has also made personal remarks about her, including telling her she should smile more, which critics viewed as a pattern of attacking female journalists.

Additionally, in October 2023, the estate and Dr. Luke were sued by artist PD Beats, who claimed he was a credited co-writer of the song ""Not Enough"" from *Fighting Demons* but had been denied his rightful share of the profits and copyright ownership."
2019,Lil Pump,18,Musician - Hip-hop,,Music,,"Yes, Lil Pump has been involved in lawsuits, scandals, and controversies.

In October 2024, Lil Pump was sued by a man named Edwin Valenzuela, who alleged that the rapper, along with UFC fighter Colby Covington and streamer Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, ambushed him, falsely accused him of being a child predator, assaulted him, and attempted to force him to eat a condom. Valenzuela also claimed that Lil Pump stole his jewelry.

Previously, in March 2018, Lil Pump was reportedly sued over an alleged hit-and-run incident where a Bentley, driven by someone associated with him, collided with another vehicle, leaving the other driver injured. The lawsuit claimed that Lil Pump and his friends pulled the injured driver out of the car and fled the scene.

Lil Pump also faced controversy in December 2018 when he was accused of racism for lyrics in his song ""Butterfly Doors"" that contained Asian stereotypes and slurs. He was also criticized for mocking Asian people by pulling his eyes back while rapping the lyric. This led to diss tracks from Chinese rappers and an eventual apology from Lil Pump, with the offensive lyrics later edited out of the song.

While not a lawsuit or criminal charge, Lil Pump has also been associated with controversial online content. He participated in a livestream with Vitaly Zdorovetskiy, known for his staged sting operations aimed at catching child predators. There have also been accusations and discussions regarding Lil Pump's alleged past relationships with underage individuals, though these are not detailed as lawsuits in the provided search results."

As a child star, she felt that ""America's Got Talent"" thrust her into the spotlight, forcing her to ""sink or swim"" in the face of intense public attention. This early exposure led to her becoming a target for tabloids and online critics.

VanderWaal has also spoken about experiencing a lot of hatred online when she was younger, which she feels has desensitized her to online criticism. Some fans expressed dissatisfaction with her evolving musical direction and personal style, leading to negative comments. Additionally, her role in the 2024 film ""Megalopolis"" involved playing a character caught in a ""deep-fake sex scandal,"" which was part of her acting career's exploration of more mature themes. This portrayal, along with a topless scene in the film, marked a departure from her earlier ""America's Got Talent"" image."

Superior Court against Vesta Corporation, a property management company, alleging unlawful discrimination against applicants with housing vouchers, past evictions, and criminal records. The Equal Rights Center (ERC) filed the suit, asserting that Vesta's policies and practices violate several D.C. laws, including the Human Rights Act, the Rental Housing Act, and the Fair Criminal Record Screening for Housing Act. The ERC's investigation, which involved fair housing testers, raised concerns about Vesta's tenant screening policies potentially constituting illegal discrimination based on source of income, eviction history, and criminal record. The complaint also states that Vesta allegedly discriminates against individuals and families with vouchers through specific requirements and by considering their rental histories before they received vouchers.

Julian Buckner is mentioned as a founder of Vesta and founder and CEO of Showroom, a new holding company formed after Vesta acquired two furniture rental startups, Fernish and Feather. He also founded Vesta Home in 2017 and has been involved in its acquisitions of other companies.

In 2018, Rippon was involved in a political controversy when he criticized Vice President Mike Pence's anti-LGBT policies. Pence's office reportedly requested a private conversation with Rippon, which the figure skater declined.

Additionally, in a Netflix docuseries, Rippon commented on a perceived ""sinister energy"" around a French ice dancing partnership, which led to some discussion about controversy within the sport.

During the 2022 Beijing Olympics, Shiffrin experienced significant disappointment when she was disqualified from both the slalom and giant slalom events after missing gates. This led to widespread commentary, with news outlets describing it as a ""nightmare"" and a ""dream can be over within seconds"".

Another controversy arose in Semmering, Austria, in late 2025, where Shiffrin's request for a course change before the second run of a slalom race led to discussions about preferential treatment. While the course was altered for safety reasons, the timing of the change meant that most athletes had already completed their inspection, leading to a perception of an uneven playing field.

2019,Lexi Thompson,23,Golfer,LPGA,Sports,,"In 2017, Lexi Thompson was penalized four strokes during the ANA Inspiration, one of the major championships in women's golf. This penalty stemmed from a television viewer who emailed the LPGA to report a rule violation Thompson committed the previous day. The viewer claimed Thompson did not properly replace her ball before putting on the 17th hole during the third round. LPGA officials investigated the claim and determined that Thompson had breached Rule 20-7c (Playing From Wrong Place), resulting in a two-stroke penalty. She also received an additional two-stroke penalty for returning an incorrect scorecard, as she was unaware of the breach when she signed it. Thompson ultimately lost the major in a playoff to So Yeon Ryu. This incident generated significant controversy and criticism from fellow golfers and the public, with many questioning the fairness of penalties issued after the fact based on viewer input.

In another incident in 2020 at the Women's British Open, Thompson was involved in a situation where she moved grass away from her ball with her club head before a shot. While some fans and observers viewed this as a potential rule violation that could improve her lie, it was ultimately determined by officials that the grass had returned to its original position, and therefore, no breach of Rule 8.1 occurred. Although she did not make the cut in that tournament, she avoided a penalty.

More recently, in 2023, Thompson faced scrutiny after a Solheim Cup match where she shanked a crucial shot on the 18th hole. In the post-round press conference, she initially refused to comment on the shot, a response that was labeled a ""terrible question"" by U.S. captain Stacy Lewis. Thompson's reaction drew criticism on social media, but she was defended by her teammate Korda, who highlighted the pressure of the game and suggested the media was being overly critical."

Drokova also had a significant correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, appearing in his files over 1,600 times. Emails indicate she advised Epstein on media strategy to improve his image and acted as a ""Silicon Valley fixer"" for him, introducing him to tech founders. Some reports suggest that Day One Ventures' funding sources were not always transparent, with Drokova being described as ""cagey"" about her investors.

In fundraising pitches, under her maiden name Masha Drokova, she reportedly highlighted ties to wealthy Russians, including billionaires Alexander Mamut and Vladimir Yevtushenkov's conglomerate, who were listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as oligarchs. However, Drokova has since stated that she did not write the email identifying these individuals as investors and that it may have been fabricated."

2019,Blake Robbins,25,Partner,Ludlow Ventures,Venture Capital,,"Blake Robbins was involved in a significant lawsuit against the Lower Merion School District in 2010. The lawsuit, dubbed ""WebcamGate,"" alleged that the school district secretly spied on students by remotely activating webcams in school-issued laptops. Robbins, then 15 years old, was disciplined after a photograph taken by his school laptop's webcam led school officials to believe he was dealing drugs, when he claimed he was eating candy. The school district eventually settled the lawsuit for $610,000.

Separately, Blake Robbins, a partner at Ludlow Ventures, was also involved in a 2021 legal action where the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions entered a Final Order against him. This order pertained to allegations of making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors regarding Overlake Capital, and acting as an unregistered broker-dealer."

2020,Emily Ratajkowski,28,Fashion Designer,Inamorata,Art & Style,,"Emily Ratajkowski's swimwear line, Inamorata, has faced a lawsuit and customer complaints. In November 2017, designer Lisa Marie Fernandez sued Ratajkowski and Inamorata, alleging that two of the brand's designs – the ""Cardiff"" swimsuit and ""Vulcan"" top – copied her ""Poppy"" maillot and ""Leandra"" bikini top. Fernandez claimed she had registered her designs in 2015 and sought a cease and desist for the sale of the Inamorata items. Ratajkowski's representatives declined to comment at the time. This was not the first time Fernandez had accused brands of copying her designs. In a separate legal matter, Ratajkowski's brand, Inamorata Swim LLC, settled a copyright infringement case with Eva's Photography around January 2022. Additionally, Ratajkowski herself settled a similar copyright infringement lawsuit filed by photographer Javier Mateo in January 2022. More recently, in late 2023 and early 2024, customers complained about significant delays in receiving orders placed during a Black Friday sale. The brand cited overwhelming order volume and manufacturing delays, offering refunds to affected customers. Some customers reported multiple missed delivery deadlines and a lack of communication from the brand. In November 2023, Ratajkowski also faced criticism for a magazine cover shoot that some interpreted as ""fatphobic."""

There were also concerns raised about the school's low teacher credential rate, with only 18% of staff holding credentials, far below the state's requirement of 80%. Furthermore, nearly two-thirds of the staff had been employed at Kairos for less than a year, according to board meeting minutes."

She was accused of defrauding JP Morgan Chase by fabricating customer data to inflate the value of her startup, Frank, leading to its acquisition for $175 million. Javice faced federal charges including conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud. In 2023, she was charged with falsely inflating customer numbers to induce JP Morgan Chase to buy her company. Ultimately, she was sentenced to 85 months in prison and ordered to pay $287 million in restitution to JP Morgan. This case has drawn comparisons to that of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes and has been cited as an example of a ""Forbes 30 Under 30 curse,"" where individuals featured on the list have later faced legal trouble."

These tweets resurfaced shortly after she was named the editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue.

The tweets included derogatory remarks about Asian people, such as ""stupid Asian T.A."" and ""googling how to not wake up with swollen, Asian eyes"". This led to backlash from media figures, Teen Vogue staff, and the public, particularly given the rise in anti-Asian violence at the time. Major advertisers, including Ulta Beauty, paused their advertising campaigns with Teen Vogue in response to the controversy. As a result of the backlash, McCammond resigned from her position at Teen Vogue before she officially started.

McCammond had previously apologized for these tweets in 2019 when they first resurfaced. She apologized again in 2021, calling the posts ""offensive"" and ""idiotic,"" and expressing regret for perpetuating stereotypes. She later rejoined Axios as a political reporter in July 2021. In July 2024, she faced criticism for an Instagram post about her ex-boyfriend, which led to her departure from The Washington Post."

The term ""Illenials"" used by some fans has also been criticized as ""cringe-y"" and cult-like.

Taylor accused Shumpert of leaking sealed divorce documents, which led to her facing online scrutiny and hate speech. She claimed that Shumpert leaked misleading information about assets awarded in the divorce, and that this occurred strategically as her career was gaining momentum. Taylor further alleged that the settlement story was published when Shumpert released a new song, suggesting he was using their divorce for promotional purposes. In response to these accusations, Shumpert's lawyer denied that he had leaked any information.

Subsequently, Taylor was found in contempt of court for violating the terms of her divorce agreement, specifically for speaking out publicly about the settlement details. As a result, she was ordered to pay Shumpert $70,000 in attorney fees. Taylor later stated that this payment was ""the best little coin I ever spent"" for the peace it brought her. There was also a report of Shumpert suing Taylor for $7 million, alleging she violated their divorce agreement.

This content resulted in him being temporarily banned from performing in the United Kingdom in 2015. He also canceled a tour in Australia in 2015 after protests from a feminist group.

In more recent years, controversies have also stemmed from resurfaced posts from his early career (2012-2014) and his online interactions. In 2024, his tribute to D'Angelo led to backlash after his comment section was reportedly flooded with insensitive remarks from fans, sparking a debate about race and his fanbase. This incident also brought attention to past tweets where he made anti-Black and offensive comments, and he also liked a post that criticized his fanbase for not engaging with Black art meaningfully.

Additionally, Tyler, The Creator has been involved in legal issues. In 2018, he was sued over his song ""Deathcamp"" for allegedly recreating a sample instead of clearing it.

Former employees have claimed that Pierson inflated subscriber numbers and misled clients. Forbes itself published an exposé detailing these claims, noting that a significant investment that led to a $200 million valuation was made without the investor reviewing the company's financials. Additionally, Pierson was reportedly pushed out of her co-founder role at the mental health startup Wondermind due to disagreements. While these reports detail accusations and internal issues, they do not mention any criminal charges filed against her as of the publication date of the articles."

In July 2021, Chen apologized for homophobic remarks he made on a podcast, where he discussed stereotypes about male figure skaters. He expressed frustration with stereotypes of being a straight skater in a ""homosexual-dominated sport"" and issued a video apology on Twitter.

During the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, Chen faced criticism from some Chinese netizens. His performance was described as ""brutish"" and ""ape-like"" by some, and he was accused of ""insulting China"" due to his past comments on Xinjiang, where he appeared to support criticisms regarding China's treatment of the Uyghur minority.

It is important to note that these instances do not constitute lawsuits or legal scandals directly involving Nathan Chen, but rather public controversies and criticisms. There are no indications of him being targeted by any lawsuits or significant scandals."

His family, particularly his brother Jackson Mahomes and wife Brittany Mahomes, have garnered negative attention for their conduct. Jackson Mahomes has faced accusations of assault, while Brittany Mahomes has been involved in social media feuds. There were also rumors that Patrick Mahomes wished his family would stop attending games due to their disruptive behavior, though he denied this.

Mahomes himself has faced scrutiny regarding officiating in NFL games, with accusations of receiving favorable calls. He has also been fined for a ""violent gesture"" during a game, and faced criticism for ""flopping"" in an attempt to draw a penalty. He has also been subject to social media speculation regarding a hot mic moment where he asked a referee for assistance, though it was later clarified he was ensuring his offensive line was following the rules.

Additionally, a restaurant co-owned by Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, named 1587 Prime, opened in 2025 and was later embroiled in a lawsuit involving fraud, embezzlement, and discrimination.

It is worth noting that the Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list has had other honorees face significant legal issues, including fraud charges and prison time, such as Sam Bankman-Fried and Charlie Javice. However, these are not directly related to Patrick Mahomes."

The SEC's complaint alleged that between February 2018 and November 2019, SC Development Fund raised approximately $19.8 million from about 30 investors, primarily from Chinese-speaking communities in the U.S. and China. Contrary to representations made to investors, the fund allegedly used investor money for loans to Zhang's real estate development and contracting business, as well as other entities under his control. Additionally, Zhang and Tseng are accused of misleading investors by using fund money to pay finder's fees to entities they secretly controlled. SC Development Fund filed for bankruptcy in July 2020 and is now defunct. The SEC sought permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Zhang and Tseng."

DeAngelis also faced controversy when videos and images surfaced of him from his college days appearing in gay adult films under the pseudonym ""Seth Rose"". This led to accusations of hypocrisy given his public stance against LGBTQ+ inclusion in education. In response, DeAngelis acknowledged his past, stating he was a victim of poor decisions and influences, and that he had grown from the experience. Following the revelations, some organizations, such as the American Federation for Children, reportedly placed him on leave and removed references to him from their website. He has also been accused of pushing ""groomer"" rhetoric against LGBTQ+ rights."

The co-founder alleged that he wired $16 million to HODL RANCH for the acquisition of the power station and an additional $3.5 million for an expansion, but that Liegl failed to raise capital from venture capitalists and that the co-founder himself continued making personal contributions totaling $6.4 million. The lawsuit also alleged that Layer1 had no source of income or capital other than the co-founder's contributions, and that Liegl never contributed his own money or raised funds from venture capitalists."

A former Rippling employee, Keith O'Brien, provided an affidavit detailing how he allegedly conveyed internal communications and trade secrets to Deel leadership. Rippling's lawsuit claims Bouaziz personally directed the acquisition of stolen customer lists and product roadmaps.

In response, Deel has countersued Rippling, alleging defamation, libel, and deceptive trade practices. Deel also accused a Rippling employee of infiltrating Deel's customer platform by posing as an executive of a fictitious company. The legal battles between the two companies are ongoing."

A class action lawsuit was filed against Zac Prince, Flori Marquez, and other BlockFi executives on behalf of investors in BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIAs) between March 2019 and November 2022. The lawsuit alleges that BlockFi and its executives made misleading statements about the security of BIAs and failed to disclose the risks associated with them, including BlockFi's exposure to FTX and Alameda Research.

Additionally, BlockFi itself initiated legal action to recover collateral for a loan taken out by Alameda Research from BlockFi. In a settlement reached in July 2023, BlockFi's bankruptcy proceedings included a resolution of potential legal claims against co-founders Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, among other officers. There are also mentions of Flori Marquez being heard in court regarding a dispute over $4,000, with the funds allegedly coming from a gambling platform. Furthermore, a YouTube video discussing ""Forbes' Accidental Criminal Hall of Fame"" lists Flori Marquez among individuals who have faced public scandals or legal issues."

*   **Proposition 65 Lawsuit:** In December 2023, the nonprofit group **Keep America Safe and Beautiful (KASB)** filed a formal lawsuit against **Diaspora Co. LLC** and Sana Javeri Kadri (as CEO) in the San Francisco Superior Court (*KASB v. Diaspora Co. LLC*, Case No. CGC-23-611124). The lawsuit alleges a violation of California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (**Proposition 65**) for failing to provide a ""clear and reasonable warning"" regarding exposure to lead in its **Kudligi Moringa** product. This followed a 60-day notice of violation served in July 2023.
*   **Sqirl Collaboration Scandal:** In July 2020, Diaspora Co. faced a public relations controversy when it launched a collaboration jam with the Los Angeles restaurant **Sqirl** (owned by Jessica Koslow) just as the restaurant became the center of a major scandal. Reports emerged that Sqirl had been serving moldy jam and fostering a toxic, inequitable workplace. Sana Javeri Kadri publicly terminated the partnership and expressed deep regret, stating that the collaboration was in ""direct opposition"" to her company's mission of BIPOC equity and worker ownership.
*   **Identity-Based Backlash:** Kadri has noted in multiple interviews that she faced significant ""backlash"" and ""immediate pushback"" from some customers starting in 2018 after publicly identifying Diaspora Co. as a ""proudly queer business.""
*   **Supply Chain Litigation:** While not a lawsuit against Kadri herself, Diaspora Co. was significantly affected by a ""lengthy court battle"" and lawsuit targeting its primary cardamom partner, the Baraka estate in India. The litigation was initiated by neighbors attempting to seize the farm's land, which resulted in major disruptions to Diaspora Co.'s supply."

This ban was related to Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) violations. Wang later revealed that he had asked a friend to file the DMCA report against him as a way to troll the Twitch community and expose what he perceived as their gullibility. The ban itself was temporary, lasting only 48 hours.

Additionally, in 2017, Wang received a 72-hour ban from Hearthstone for showcasing an exploit on stream. In early 2019, he was criticized on Reddit for his extensive use of clickbait in YouTube thumbnails. In May 2021, Wang addressed accusations of making ""problematic"" comments in the past, including allegedly racist and sexist jokes, issuing a detailed response to the criticism. In October 2025, Wang spoke out about an ""uncomfortable"" encounter he had with fellow streamer Nina Lin, detailing an incident where Lin ""grabbed at my ass"" while he was lying on a massage table."

The cause of death was determined to be an adverse reaction to the viral vector used in the therapy, exacerbated by Terry's age and the advanced stage of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This event was made public through a case report published on a preprint server, which has not yet undergone peer review. Cure Rare Disease stated that they are making the report available to the rare disease community while submitting it for peer review. Rich Horgan mentioned that they did not get to learn if the therapeutic was effective, but that they learned valuable information to apply to ongoing programs and share with the broader gene therapy field."

McLaughlin also noted that some fans still don't support him because he is Black and wondered why he had the least followers among the main cast members from Season 1. He stated that this experience affected him as a child, and his parents had to explain that it was because he was the Black child on the show.

Additionally, McLaughlin received some criticism for a sexually suggestive joke he made during a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit that referenced his ""Stranger Things"" character, Lucas Sinclair, and his on-screen relationship with Max. Some viewers found the joke to be in poor taste and ""disgusting""."

The managers claimed they had worked tirelessly to promote Carpenter's music until their services were terminated without cause. Carpenter ultimately won this lawsuit, and some believe she referenced the experience in her song ""Sue Me.""

More recently, in 2023, Carpenter faced controversy surrounding the music video for her song ""Feather."" The video, filmed in a church, led to a Mass of Reparation to ""restore the sanctity of this church and repair the harm"" after some parishioners were offended. Carpenter responded by stating that they had received prior approval for the filming.

Additionally, at the 2026 Grammy Awards, Carpenter's performance drew criticism from PETA for using a live dove, which the animal rights organization called ""stupid, slow, useless and cruel."""

The inclusion of an Israeli character in the MCU, especially one with a history in the comics as a Mossad agent, sparked protests and calls for boycotts, particularly due to the Gaza–Israel conflict and the name ""Sabra"" itself, which has associations with the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre. Haas herself also reportedly received anti-Semitic threats in connection with this role. Marvel Studios has stated they are taking a ""new approach"" with the character for the film, and her role has been rewritten as a former Black Widow and a high-ranking U.S. government official, downplaying her direct ties to Israeli intelligence. Some pro-Israel advocates have expressed displeasure with this change, while critics of Israel remain opposed to the character's inclusion."

In November, a former employee of Yang's at Manhattan GMAT filed a lawsuit against him, alleging he paid her less than her male co-workers and subsequently fired her for asking for a raise. Yang and another employee disputed these claims. Additionally, a former employee testified that Yang fired her because he believed she wouldn't work as hard after getting married, which Yang also denied.

In a separate federal discrimination lawsuit, a volunteer for ""Friends of Andrew Yang"" claimed that her concerns about online sexism and misogyny were dismissed, and she was removed from her role after flagging the issues. The lawsuit also argued that Yang was not responsible for harassment by his fanbase, and his campaign's defense was that her claims were irrelevant because she was ""just a volunteer.""

Furthermore, during the 2020 presidential primaries, Yang's promise to give 10 families $1,000 a month for a year drew criticism, with one opponent claiming it was a blatant violation of FEC rules. However, the Federal Election Commission stated that this scenario was not explicitly addressed in their rules, leaving it in a ""legal gray area."""

Prosecutors allege that Rothschild raised millions in seed funding for a fintech startup by misrepresenting revenues, partnerships, and business traction to investors. This alleged deliberate distortion of financial performance is considered a serious offense in the fintech industry, which relies on trust, data integrity, and regulatory compliance. The case highlights a recurring issue within the startup and fintech ecosystem, where a strong emphasis on growth narratives can sometimes mask underlying problems. Rothschild's situation is part of a broader trend, as other individuals featured on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" lists have also faced legal troubles, including charges of fraud and conspiracy."

2021,Polo G,21,MUSICIAN - HIP-HOP,,Music,,"Polo G, whose legal name is Taurus Tremani Bartlett, was recognized in the 2021 Forbes 30 Under 30 list under the music category. He has been involved in several lawsuits and controversies.

In September 2022, Polo G and fellow rapper G Herbo were named in a $300,000 lawsuit by concert promoter Charles Potter of NoNaNi Entertainment. The promoter accused them of double-booking concert dates in Tampa and Atlanta, leading to the cancellation of a festival. Potter claimed that Polo G and G Herbo took deposits for the Tampa festival but then performed at other shows in different cities instead.

In June 2025, Polo G settled a legal dispute with a Dutch booking agency, J. Noah B.V., over a canceled European tour in 2023. The rapper accused the agency of using his name without permission after their deal terminated, while the agency counter-sued, alleging breach of contract due to fake cancellation reasons.

Additionally, Polo G has faced legal troubles including arrests for gun charges. In one instance following an album release event, he was charged with resisting arrest, battery on an officer, criminal mischief, and threatening a public servant."

2021,Richard Camacho,23,,,Music,,"Richard Camacho, a journalist who was honored by Forbes' ""30 Under 30,"" was involved in a lawsuit with the City of Los Angeles. The city initially sued Camacho to reclaim photographs of police officers it claimed were mistakenly released to him. Camacho had previously sued the city to obtain these photographs as part of a public records request. The city's lawsuit against Camacho was eventually settled, with the city agreeing to pay Camacho and a related advocacy group $300,000 in legal fees. Camacho stated that the settlement was a ""win for the public, the first amendment and ensures we will continue to have radical transparency within the LAPD.""

It's important to note that other individuals with the name Richard Camacho have been involved in different legal matters, including a former US Army Captain who faced a general court-martial and an individual connected to drug trafficking.

In 2021, Defector Media created an award in his name to humorously acknowledge confusing journalistic sentences."

2021,Vivek Ramaswami,29,PRINCIPAL,REDPOINT VENTURES,Venture Capital,,"Vivek Ramaswamy has faced several lawsuits and controversies related to his business dealings. Two former employees of his company, Strive Asset Management, filed lawsuits alleging that they were pressured into violating securities laws and that Ramaswamy misrepresented the company's finances. One of these lawsuits also included claims of age discrimination and retaliation for reporting misconduct.

Additionally, Ramaswamy's business practices at Roivant Sciences have drawn scrutiny. While the company's strategy was to acquire patents for drugs developed by others and bring them to market, it has been noted that the company has never turned a profit and has incurred significant losses. One of its subsidiaries, Axovant, which focused on an Alzheimer's drug, was taken public in a large IPO but ultimately failed and is being liquidated. Critics have also questioned his approach, describing him as a ""Wall Street finance bro"" who profits from capital gains rather than innovation. There have also been accusations of fraud regarding scholarship money he received while allegedly earning a substantial income. Ramaswamy has also been criticized for his business strategies, with some suggesting he engages in ""pump-and-dump schemes""."

Tran has responded to these allegations with his own statements and videos, where he addressed the claims regarding AI usage. However, the situation has sparked significant debate within the art community, with many artists expressing concern over the ethical implications of AI in art and the potential for exploitation. Further allegations include claims that Tran copied character names and motifs from another artist, and that he presented AI-generated art as his own by painting over it to conceal its origins."

Additionally, the app has been criticized for its pricing model, with some comparing its annual subscription cost to medieval indulgences. The conservative Catholic magazine *Crisis* has also criticized Hallow as ""shallow"" and accused the app of ""problematic monetization and celebritization of prayer"".

2022,Joshua Sakhai,25,Cofounder,Ephemeral Tattoo,Consumer Technology,,"Joshua Sakhai, co-founder of Ephemeral Tattoo, has been associated with a controversy surrounding the company's ""made-to-fade"" tattoos. Customers have reported that their tattoos did not fade within the initially promised 9-15 month timeframe, with some tattoos remaining visible for much longer, even after three years. This has led to accusations of false advertising and disappointment among customers who felt misled.

In response to these complaints, Ephemeral Tattoo updated its fade time estimates, eventually stating in February 2023 that 70% of tattoos would fade within three years. The company also reportedly stopped responding to customers seeking refunds for tattoos that lasted longer than three years and has been accused of paying people to leave positive reviews on Reddit to drown out negative feedback.

There are also reports of a class-action lawsuit being organized by customers who experienced issues with the tattoos not fading as advertised. The company has since closed its studios but continues to work with tattoo artists to provide its ink."

There are also claims that the ""Done For You"" services were not delivered as promised, and that students were instead directed to YouTube videos for instruction. Some critics argue that Bolt is an internet marketer who profits from ""gullible people"" rather than a true publishing expert.

A separate complaint was also filed with the Federal Elections Commission by former congressional candidate Robert Zimmerman, alleging that Lafazan used the loan as a ""straw donation"" to illegally funnel money into his campaign.

In a separate incident, Lafazan was featured in a political advertisement that he claimed depicted him using ""stereotypical antisemitic tropes,"" comparing the imagery to materials used during the Nazi era. He stated that this was the first time he had faced antisemitism in a campaign."

In late 2025, news broke that Fireflies.ai's early product development involved the founders manually taking notes during meetings while presenting the service as an AI bot. This practice, which occurred in 2017 during beta testing, led to a debate about ""fake it till you make it"" startup strategies. While the founders stated they were transparent with beta customers about having a ""human in the loop"", some users criticized this approach as misrepresentation and potential fraud.

More significantly, Fireflies.ai is facing a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court, *Cruz v. Fireflies.AI Corp.*. The lawsuit alleges that the company illegally collects and stores biometric voice data of meeting participants without their knowledge or consent, violating Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The complaint asserts that Fireflies.ai's tool records, analyzes, transcribes, and stores unique vocal characteristics (""voiceprints"") of all participants, including those who are not users of the service. The plaintiffs argue that these voiceprints are sensitive biometric identifiers and that the company lacks a public retention and destruction policy for this data."

Caroline Ellison, as the former CEO of Alameda Research, pleaded guilty to multiple fraud and money laundering charges in relation to the FTX bankruptcy. She testified in court as a key government witness and was sentenced to two years in prison. A lawsuit also alleged that Ellison paid herself a $22.5 million bonus using misappropriated funds shortly before FTX's bankruptcy.

Sam Trabucco, the former co-CEO of Alameda Research, has agreed to forfeit significant assets, including a yacht and apartments, as part of a settlement with FTX creditors. While Trabucco has not faced criminal charges for the FTX collapse, his name surfaced in court proceedings concerning a bribery scandal involving Chinese officials. He stepped down from Alameda Research shortly before its collapse."

The lawsuit claims that Kalshi users bet not only against each other but also against the house, with Kalshi's institutional market makers gambling against the consumer. Luana Lopes Lara, a co-founder of Kalshi, responded to the lawsuit by stating that it mischaracterized Kalshi Trading's role and that such a setup is common and regulated in the industry, providing liquidity and a better user experience. She also referred to the lawsuit as a ""smear campaign"" backed by a competitor and described the allegations as baseless. Kalshi Trading, according to Lopes Lara, receives no preferential treatment and operates as a separate team. Another lawsuit from last year also made similar allegations about Kalshi's dedicated trading team functioning like a sportsbook."

Additionally, in 2019, she faced accusations of stealing artwork and attempting to pass it off as her own, an accusation she later acknowledged and apologized for.

It is important to note that separate from Pearce's own controversies, the ""Forbes 30 Under 30"" list has, in some instances, included individuals who later faced legal troubles and scandals, such as Charlie Javice, founder of Frank, who was charged with fraud related to the sale of her company to JP Morgan."

Launched in October 2021, RFLCT claimed to protect gamers' skin from blue light emitted by screens. However, the brand received backlash due to a lack of sufficient scientific evidence supporting its claims. Experts stated that prolonged screen time was unlikely to cause skin damage unless someone already had pre-existing conditions like melasma or hyperpigmentation. Hofstetter acknowledged the criticism, stating that the concerns were valid and that she was upset by the lack of information on the brand's website. She also expressed that she was contractually bound to RFLCT and wished to part ways with the brand. The controversy significantly impacted her mental health, but she later stated that she was recovering and did not want the situation to hinder her further. Additionally, Hofstetter's cameo was cut from ""A Minecraft Movie"" after she made comments about Jason Momoa mistreating crew members, which she stated she would ""much rather not have that 30 seconds than be sued."""

Leda Health subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the Attorney General's office, alleging coercion and retaliation.

Additionally, in October 2022, the Attorney General's office in Washington state issued a cease-and-desist letter, stating that Leda Health's practices were ""unfair and deceptive.""

In 2020, Thorne joined OnlyFans and generated significant controversy. She claimed she was using the platform for research for a film role, but then offered pay-per-view photos she advertised as nude, which turned out to be lingerie pictures. This led to many users requesting refunds, which in turn allegedly prompted OnlyFans to implement new site-wide restrictions on content pricing and payment schedules. Sex workers criticized Thorne, blaming her for changes that negatively impacted their income.

Thorne has also accused actor Mickey Rourke of abusive and disturbing behavior on the set of their 2020 film ""Girl."" She alleged that Rourke repeatedly struck her pelvic area with a metal grinder during a scene, causing injury and distress. Rourke's representatives denied any intentional misconduct.

Additionally, in 2019, Thorne preemptively leaked nude photos of herself that hackers had threatened to release. While many supported her decision to reclaim her power, some, like Whoopi Goldberg, criticized her for taking such photos in the first place. There have also been accusations of Thorne using racial slurs in the past, though she has reportedly not addressed these claims. Thorne was also accused of copying a black-owned beauty brand's eyeshadow palette in 2018."

There are also allegations and discussions surrounding a ""controversy"" related to Dan Schneider, a producer with whom Cosgrove worked on Nickelodeon shows.

2022,Amanda Gorman,23,Poet,,Media,,"Amanda Gorman has been involved in a controversy regarding a book ban in a Florida school. A parent filed a complaint about Gorman's poem ""The Hill We Climb,"" leading to the book being moved to a section of the school library for older students. Social media posts inaccurately claimed the poem was banned from all elementary schools in the county. Gorman expressed that she was ""gutted"" by the decision, and her publisher, along with other organizations like PEN America, has joined a lawsuit against another Florida school district that has banned books. Additionally, there was a controversy in the Netherlands where the initially chosen translator for Gorman's poetry withdrew after criticism that the translator was not Black."

2022,Fletcher,27,Musician - Pop,,Music,,"The musician Fletcher has faced accusations of sexual assault and knowingly infecting partners with STDs. She denies the assault charges but admits to having unprotected sex without disclosing her STD status. Fletcher has also sued one of her accusers for harassment. In a separate case, former San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher was dismissed from a lawsuit by a former employee who accused him of sexual assault and having her fired after their affair. The accuser claimed Fletcher engaged in discovery abuse, including altering and deleting evidence. Additionally, there have been controversies surrounding the release of Fletcher's song ""Boy,"" with accusations of queerbaiting, particularly due to its release during Pride Month and messaging that some fans perceived as a betrayal of the LGBTQ+ community.

Several individuals featured on Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" list have faced legal issues. Charlie Javice, founder of the financial aid startup Frank, was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase for inflating her company's customer numbers. She faces up to 30 years in prison and a separate civil trial from JPMorgan. Gökçe Güven, founder of the fintech startup Kalder, is charged with fraud for allegedly defrauding investors. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, was arrested and charged with defrauding investors, leading to his company's bankruptcy, and was sentenced to prison. Joanna Smith-Griffin, founder of an education-technology startup, was charged with fraud for allegedly lying to investors."

2022,Klaudia Zadlo,26,Director,"Global Research & Insights, Capitol Records",Music,,"Charlie Javice, a Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree, has been involved in a significant lawsuit and controversy. She was accused of defrauding JPMorgan Chase by inflating her startup Frank's customer numbers to secure a $175 million acquisition deal. Prosecutors alleged that she claimed Frank had 4.25 million users when it actually had fewer than 300,000. This led to JPMorgan suing her for fraud after discovering the alleged deception. Javice, in turn, sued JPMorgan for legal costs and a retention bonus. She was found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan in March 2025. This case has drawn comparisons to the Theranos scandal and has been linked to a phenomenon some call the ""Forbes 30 Under 30 curse,"" where individuals on the list have faced legal troubles."

2022,Lil Durk,29,Musician - Hip-hop,,Music,,"Lil Durk, who was featured on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list for 2022, has faced a significant lawsuit and allegations of ordering hits. In December 2023, a fintech startup named Exceed Talent Capital filed a $12 million lawsuit against Lil Durk, alleging ""manifest fraud"" in a deal to sell the rights to his song ""Bedtime."" The startup claimed that Lil Durk had already assigned these rights to a third party and that he had an exclusive contract with Alamo Records, which led to the legal action.

Furthermore, in October 2024, federal prosecutors accused Lil Durk of orchestrating a murder-for-hire plot in 2022. These accusations stem from an alleged plot to target rapper Quando Rondo as retaliation for the 2020 killing of Lil Durk's friend, King Von. Although Quando Rondo was not killed, his cousin, Savvia Robinson, was. Lil Durk is accused of ordering, funding, and directing the hit, leading to federal charges including conspiracy, firearm offenses, and murder for hire. It has also been reported that supporters of Lil Durk allegedly threatened the judge and prosecutors, and he was reportedly caught trying to destroy an Apple Watch while in jail."

2022,Olivia Rodrigo,18,Musician—Pop,,Music,,"Olivia Rodrigo has faced accusations of plagiarism, leading to retroactive songwriting credits for several of her songs. These claims primarily concern her debut album, ""Sour."" Specifically, songwriting credits were added for Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff on ""1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back"" (inspired by Swift's ""New Year's Day"") and ""Deja Vu"" (inspired by Swift's ""Cruel Summer""). Additionally, Paramore's Hayley Williams and Josh Farro received credits on Rodrigo's hit ""Good 4 U"" due to similarities with Paramore's ""Misery Business.""

While these situations sparked significant online discussion and controversy, no lawsuits were officially filed against Rodrigo. Instead, agreements were reached regarding songwriting credits and monetization. Rodrigo herself has addressed the controversy, stating that ""nothing in music is ever new"" and that all music is inspired by each other. Her producer, Dan Nigro, also commented that ""people get funny about things when songs become really popular,"" referencing the precedent set by previous music copyright disputes."
